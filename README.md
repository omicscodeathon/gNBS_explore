# **Exploring genomic new-born screening using next generation sequencing data**


## **Background**

Newborn screening (NBS) aim at identifying neonates in need of immediate life-saving treatment to improve health outcomes, or reduce morbidity through immediate, pre-symptomatic treatment (Veldman et al., 2022). NBS started early in the 1960s with focus on phenylketonuria (PKU) to prevent severe intellectual disability (Guthrie & Susi, 1963). Advancements in technology and improved scientific knowledge over time have expanded NBS to include multiple disorders.

NBS programs are predominantly used for inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) with a monogenetic origin. It is noteworthy that NBS  countries  but some countries screen for genetic non-IMDs as well (Veldman et al., 2022). About 33.3% of the global newborn population benefit from NBS currently. However, most of them residing in countries with developing only receive screening for a single condition while those in developed countries may be screened for over 50 conditions (Therrell et al., 2015). 

The current NBS programs in Africa are predominantly along the coast and organized NBS within the African continent is limited (Therrell  Jr et al., 2020). The implementation of NBS in Africa faces major challenges related to contact tracing, time of sample collection, and scarcity of resources among others. Therefore, this project aims at identifying novel variants associated with metabolic disorders among neonates living in Africa.

## **Objectives**

1.	To identify novel variants of metabolic disorders in neonates in the African context
2.	To link the identified variants to the associated physiological diseased states in the African context

## **Significance of the study**

Blood sample dependent NBS programs are dependent on technologies such as mass spectrometry and genetic sequencing. The routine application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in clinical laboratories has given rise to significant opportunities for NBS, thereby improving health among infants and children. It is noteworthy that NBS is an effective strategy in the prevention of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) with emphasis on timely detection of deteriorating health outcomes and early treatment. While critical to improving survival and associated cost effectiveness, the implementation of NBS is particularly challenging in low-income, high-burden settings such as those in much of Africa (Kato et al., 2018).
