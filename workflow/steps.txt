Steps:
. Pull down the reads (Fasterq-dump)
. Quality Control (FastQC, MultiQC)
. Trimming (TrimGalore, Trimmomatic, Cutadapt)
. Map the genome to reference (BWA, human - GRCh38 Refseq assembly)
. GATK (base quality score recalibration)
. Marking Duplicates
. Generate VCFs / Variant Calling (Approach 1: 99 vcfs, 99 annotations. Approach 2: a single VCF, filter out variants, )
. Annotation (SnpEff, ANOVA {include dbSNP, ClinVAR etc})
. Identify Variants of Interest (Data Manipulation / Hard Filtering)
